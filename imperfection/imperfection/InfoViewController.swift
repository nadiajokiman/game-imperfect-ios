We also wanted to spread a positive message so that females know what to do in a situation that can be life threatening or dangerous, to show how to be cautious on your surroundings. Some males don't want to just read a article on how to treat a female, so we decided why not take an activity that most males just love to do and spread a message while doing it!\n"
